```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(magrittr)

# Convert grViz code to PDF and include it in the RMarkdown document.

# Introduction

Below is a simple causal diagram (`IV --> DV`) that will be included as vector
graphics (PDF) with a caption using `fig.cap` option.

You can control the width and height with `fig.width` and `fig.height` as well.

```{r diagram, fig.cap="Our first diagram.", fig.width=1, fig.height=1}
code <- "
  digraph causal {
	# Nodes
	node [shape = reactangle, fontname = Arial]
	iv [label = 'Independent\nvariable']
	dv  [label = 'Dependent\nvariable']

	# Edges
	edge [color = black, arrowhead = normal]
	rankdir = LR
	iv -> dv

	# Graph
	graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10]
}"

create_pdf_diagram("diagram.pdf", code)
```
